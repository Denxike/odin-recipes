    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot .</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
        <ul>1 ¾ cups hot water</ul>

        <ul>3 tablespoons olive oil, or more to taste</ul>
    
        <ul>2 tablespoons quick-rise yeast</ul>
    
        <ul>1 tablespoon white sugar</ul>
    
        <ul>1 teaspoon salt</ul>
    
        <ul>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><strong>Step 1</strong> :"Beat water, olive oil, yeast, sugar, and salt together with an electric mixer until evenly combined, about 2 minutes. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon after each addition, until dough almost comes away from the sides of the bowl.  "</ol>
    <ol><strong>Step 2</strong> :"Knead the dough with your hands until soft and smooth. Lightly oil a bowl and place dough in the bowl, flipping to coat all of the dough. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.  "</ol>
